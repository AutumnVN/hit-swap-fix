# hit-swap-nerf

An attempt to ~~fix~~ nerf hit swapping cuz i cant find one on internet

Requires [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper) and Minecraft 1.21.4+

## What tf is hit swap?

Mojang Bug Tracker: [MC-28289](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-28289) (holyshit 12 year old bug)

It's also called "sword swapping", "bleach swapping",... You can search it up on YouTube

By swapping item and attacking at the same time, it uses base damage & cooldown of original item and enchantments & ability to disable shield of swapped item

Players can abuse this to break shield with sword, fire/knockback with axe, bleach with sword (super OP btw), preserve durability of original item,...

This plugin doesn't fix the core issue (i suck), but it properly resets attack cooldown when swapping item, so player deals way less damage, thus making the exploit worthless (hopefully)
