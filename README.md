Mojang Bug Tracker: [MC-28289](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-28289) (holyshit 12 year old bug)

It's also called "sword swapping", "breach swapping",... You can search it up on YouTube

By swapping item and attacking at the same time, it uses base damage & cooldown of original item and enchantments & ability to disable shield of swapped item

Players can abuse this to break shield with sword, fire/knockback with axe, breach with sword (super OP btw), preserve durability of original item,...

This plugin resets attack cooldown and refreshes player attributes to new item when player swaps item
